Expense Tracker

This is a simple project I made to track my daily spending without relying on any external apps. You can add expenses, categorize them, check your total, and edit or delete entries whenever you want. It saves your data so everything stays even after you refresh. The whole point was to keep it minimal, fast, and easy to use.

What it does:
Add expenses with amount, category, and date
Edit or delete entries
Shows total spent
Keeps data saved
Works on both mobile and desktop

Tech used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
(LocalStorage or your backend if you added one)

How to run it:
If it’s only frontend, just open index.html in the browser.
If it has a backend, run the main file (for example, python app.py).

Folder structure:
index.html
style.css
script.js
assets folder (optional)

Why I built it:
I wanted something small and useful to track my own expenses, and at the same time practice basic CRUD operations, UI design, and clean code. This version is lightweight, easy to maintain, and actually practical for everyday use.

Future ideas:
Add monthly charts
Export to CSV
Dark mode
Login system and cloud backup

If you want, I can rewrite this in an even more casual tone or match your exact repo files.
